# Pixel Quest: Lost in the Labyrinth

"Pixel Quest: Lost in the Labyrinth" is a classic 2D adventure game that takes players through

assume the role of a daring adventurer striving to uncover treasures, avoid enemies, and ultimately
find their way out of the labyrinthine depths.

## Game Overview
### Game Level Rules:

The game comprises three levels, each featuring a maze filled with walls, treasures,
enemies, and randomized traps.

1. Randomized traps is a mini-game/challenge the player must win which includes:
- Random riddles
- Logic quiz questions
- Rock, Paper, Scissors
- Card Matching Game

2. The primary objective is to reach the exit of each level as swiftly as possible while
collecting as many treasures as you can. Players must successfully conquer the mini-
game traps and navigate past enemies to progress through the levels.

3. Time limits are in effect, adding an element of urgency to each level. These time limits
also apply to the mini-game traps, intensifying the challenge.

4. At the end of the game, leaderboards are presented, allowing players to see and compare
their scores with others. This competitive aspect enhances the overall gaming experience.

### Game Mechanics:
#### Player Life System:
The player's character begins the game with 5 hearts. Failing to complete a level within
the specified time limit results in a game over for the player. Losing all of these lives leads
to a game over as well, but players have the option to continue from the beginning of the
first level. A life is lost when the character touches an enemy and
mini-games results in a time penalty, reducing the time available to complete the level.

#### Game Scoring:
Players accumulate points by collecting gems, successfully evading enemies, and
completing levels. The more gems you collect, the higher your score.

The game incorporates a leaderboard feature, which ranks players based on two key
factors: the highest number of gems collected. This feature
adds a competitive edge to the game, allowing players to compare their achievements
with others and strive for the top spots on the leaderboard.

#### Level Up:
As players progress through the game, they advance to more challenging levels with
larger maze maps, more enemies, frequent traps, and more rewarded gems.

Each new level introduces unique elements and obstacles such as:

- Locked Doors
- Traps

#### Character Movement Keys:
- Up Arrow Key: Move the character up
- Down Arrow Key: Move the character down
- Left Arrow Key: Move the character to the left
